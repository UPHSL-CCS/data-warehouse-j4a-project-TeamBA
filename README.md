# Data Warehouse Optimization Project - TeamBA

## Project Overview

**Project Title:** Retail Sales Performance Analytics  
**Course:** Data Warehousing (J4A)  
**Institution:** UPHSL-CCS  
**Presentation Date:** October 22, 2025

### Objective
Implement and analyze data warehouse optimization techniques using cloud-based tools to improve query performance through:
- Partitioning
- Clustering
- Materialized views
- Version-controlled collaboration

### Business Problem
A local retail company wants to analyze sales performance across products, stores, and time to make better inventory and pricing decisions.

## ETL Process

> **Note:** This ETL process is subject to change based on actual dataset structure and project requirements.

### Extract
**Data Sources:**
- **Custom Dataset** - Team will create/collect our own retail sales dataset
  - Point of Sale (POS) transaction records
  - Product inventory information
  - Store and location details
  - Customer purchase data (if applicable)

**Dataset Creation Methods:**
- Manual data collection from real/simulated retail scenarios
- Synthetic data generation using Mockaroo/Faker.js
- Public retail datasets (Kaggle, etc.) as reference/baseline
- CSV/Excel files prepared by the team

**Extraction Methods:**
- CSV/JSON file uploads to cloud storage
- Direct file import to BigQuery
- Database connections (PostgreSQL/MySQL) if needed
- API integrations using n8n workflows for automation

### Transform
**Data Cleaning & Transformation:**
- Remove duplicates and handle missing values
- Standardize date/time formats
- Normalize product categories and store names
- Calculate derived metrics:
  - Total sales amount (quantity Ã— price)
  - Profit margins
  - Sales trends (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Data type conversions
- Currency standardization

**Data Enrichment:**
- Add time dimensions (day, week, month, quarter, year)
- Categorize products by type, brand, price range
- Geographic data for stores (region, city)
- Customer segmentation

**Tools Used:**
- n8n for workflow orchestration
- Python (pandas) for complex transformations
- SQL for data manipulation

### Load
**Target: Google BigQuery Data Warehouse**

**Loading Strategy:**
- Incremental loads for daily transactions
- Full refresh for dimension tables (products, stores, customers)
- Partitioning by date for transaction tables
- Clustering by store_id and product_id for query optimization

**Data Warehouse Schema:**
- **Fact Table:** Sales transactions
- **Dimension Tables:**
  - Products (product_id, name, category, price)
  - Stores (store_id, name, location, region)
  - Customers (customer_id, name, segment)
  - Time (date, day, month, quarter, year)

**Optimization Techniques:**
- Table partitioning by transaction_date
- Clustering on frequently queried columns
- Materialized views for common aggregations
- Scheduled refresh strategies

**Note:** The ETL process design is flexible and will be refined based on:
- Actual dataset characteristics and size
- Data quality and completeness
- Performance testing results
- BigQuery best practices discovered during implementation
